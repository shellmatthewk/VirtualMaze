# VirtualMaze
VirtualMaze is a virtual reality environment that an animal can be trained to
navigate.  Once the animals are trained, their brains activity will be recorded
while they navigate through the virtual environment via a robotic platform.
Information acquired from this project will then be compared to the activity
recorded when navigating through a real maze.

# This Psuedo-Random version of Virtual Maze: 
This version of virtual maze pulls from a seed file located in Assets/int_seeds.txt
to decide a "random" set of trials for the test subject. This path will be able to 
be found and printed in my repo work: https://github.com/shellmatthewk/N1ShihChengLabWork/blob/main/Week3/path_distribution.ipynb
The distribution of trials can be displayed using that script. When loading the 
maze, the user must switch to Open Maze MD2, then select trials from 
multiples of 30, + 1. (31, 61, 91, 121, 151 etc)
